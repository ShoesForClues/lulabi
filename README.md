# LuLABI
Lua Light Application Building Interface [Version 0.0.1]

Software created by Jason Lee Â© 2019

LuLABI (lullaby) is a build system written in pure lua that allows the user to easily compile 
their C/C++ projects. The only dependencies are LuaFileSystem which can be acquired from 
LuaRocks, and a compiler such as GCC, DJGPP, Open Watcom or Visual Studio cl. It's supported 
to run in Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, and probably other Unix systems.

# Usage

lulabi help
lulabi build -c <compiler> -std <c_standard> -o <output_file> -f <source_directory>
